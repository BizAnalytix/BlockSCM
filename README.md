## BlockSCM - Supply Chain Management 3.0
The Automobile industry's supply chain is huge logistical arrangment that consumes a large share of any company. It mediates between multiple parties, and optimizes the creation of distribtuion of resources, but the presence of numerous interacting parties, differential pricing, and quality & complicance issues create a logistical nightmare which wastes both time and resources. The [failure of Boeing's supply chain for 787](http://www.maxqtech.com/3-true-stories-of-supply-chain-management-disasters-and-how-to-avoid-them/) led to a disastrous 3 year delay of their product. Using that as a case-study, we show blockchains are currently the best-suited solution to the problems with current supply chain infrastructure.

### The Problem
1. **Differential Pricing**: Companies prefer keeping their pricings a secret, since this allows them to pay lower prices when outsourcing to developing countries.
2. **Numerous parties involved**: Mediating between so many parties can be a big problem for logistics-providers, slowing down the delivery of services and creating a large overhead for logistics. Furthermore, a centralized mediator of these parties can misuse power to perfer some parties over others.
3. **Quality & Compliance issues**: Procuring a replacement for defective parts is a long-drawn and uncomfortable process.
4. **Inevitable disruptions**: LEAN "on-demand" manufacturing falls flat in a situations where natural disasters and socio-economic problems are common. For example, Japan (frequently affected by earthquakes) has outsourced most of it's supply chain logistics to other countries.
7. **Centralization**: A central mediator for parties is required, which centralizes power in the hands of a few and is a gateway to misuse of resources.

### How can blockchains help?

| Problems | How our solution solves them |
| --- | --- |
| Differential Pricing | Permissioned ledger for confidential transactions between parties |
| Numerous parties invovled | Consensus between multiple parties is maintained through Smart Contracts |
|  Quality & Compliance issues | All resources |
| Inevitable disruptions | Digital ledger is free of geographical constraints like natural disasters, socio-economic issues |           
| Procuring replacements for defective pieces | Smart contract only lets out payments once both parties satisified |
| Centralization | Risk of fraud is mitigated by using decentralized nodes for checking delivery status |

As we observe, the problems are both financial (interests, maintenance of accounts) and organisations (central authority => corruption). Blockchains are a unique solution which addresses both these issues. ***Blockchains are a fundamentally new way of not just organising financial capital but also social capital.*** A new way of organising finances and power in rural microfinancial groups.

__**To solve these problems, we've created an Aadhar-linked digital pan-Indian capital-pooling network. Through this network, MAXIMUM POSSIBLE microloan requests are fully funded with 0% interest (least request satisfied first) and the reserve wealth is re-distributed into the system.**__ People can exit the network by requesting their deposited money, which theyâ€™ll receive once the loans given are repayed back. This systems allows workers to not only fund each other, but also get microloans for seed-funding their own businesses.

This allows villagers all across India to pool their resources and receive **interest-free microloans** from the network. Blockchain tech enables micro-transactions (which allows for a greater inclusion for poverty-stricken individuals), automatic bookkeeping (no delay or pathy maintenance of ledgers on-chain) in a transparent (all chain transactions are open) manner. We remove the need for a group managing authority (decentralized smart contract). By needing consent from previous members to enter the network and making them accountable for him, **we introduce peer pressure into the network**. This [lowers chances of non-repayment of loans](https://www.microfinancegateway.org/library/microfinance-and-mechanics-solidarity-lending-improving-access-credit-through-innovations).

### Protocol
1. Every 3 months, all loan-requests in the network are collected and the maximum possible loan-requests are fulfilled.
2. Every person who receives a loan, has 3 months to pay back his loan. 
3. Failure to do so will mean 4 members accountable for that person (shown in video) will either make him pay or split the debt, thus creating an incentive for the four members to keep the person accountable.

## Architecture and Tech-stack

![System Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jangidkrishna/0xSHG/master/architecture.jpg)


### Architecture Modules
##### 1. Validation
Initial members of the network call add_member to add a new person to the network, once they've validated his identity using Aadhar.
##### 2. Deposit Money
The newly added member must deposit money to the pool to be able to request a loan.
##### 3. Request Loan
A person can request a loan if 
  1. He has been validated by 4 existing members
  2. He has deposited some amount of money
##### 4. Receive Loan
All loan request are sorted in increasing order of loan-request amount. Every three months, the money in pool is used to fullfill the maximum number of loan-requests. Any reserve wealth in the pool is re-distributed back to the network. The is the function of pay_loan.

## Who does it benefit
Everyone in a rural setting who requires a loan but is unable to get one due to low income and high credit-liability score, [especially rural women](https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2017/05/self-help-groups-an-anecdote-of-women-empowerment-in-india/). Our solution provides  an alternative, where a person can take zero-interest loans, without any collateral, while the network ensures the person is compelled (peer pressure on-chain) to return the amount.

## Possible problemsk
1. Adoption : Initial adoption of the system might be slow due to technical illiteracy, but [NABARD's E-Shakti initiative](https://eshakti.nabard.org/Aboutus.aspx) has shown us that once a few villages are tested, [adoption is exponential](https://eshakti.nabard.org/Downloads/EShakti%20Brochure%202017A.pdf).

2. Difference in unit of currency: The solution model requires ether/wei as the basic unit of currency. However, a similar system can be put in place for the government's cryptocurrency LakshmiCoin.

3. Possibility of leftover reserves in pool: After the distribution of loans every 3 months, there is a possibility that some amount of pool money is left unused (all loan requests satisfied). This reserve can be utilised by redistributing it equally into the network.

4. If everyone exits the network at the same time: Though this is extremely improbable, if this happens everyone in the system will have to wait 3 months to receive their money back, with possibility of losses to initial deposit (in case someone defaults and all consentees have exited network).
